    <h6><b>RESET MINDSET is based on the premise that:</b></h6>
   
    <ul>
      <li>Emotions are a survival mechanism â€“ they drive behavior. They are neither good nor bad, merely a reaction to a trigger.</li>
      <li>Strong emotions are an indicator that something needs your attention.</li>
      <li>Strong emotions are an indicator that something needs your attention.</li>
      <li>Several emotions can arise at once - focus on the predominant emotion and name it.</li>
      <li>Naming it is the first step to processing an emotion.</li>
      <li>Processed emotions will recede.</li>
      <li>nprocessed emotions accumulate and fester causing increased stress and potentially unwanted behavior.</li>
    </ul>
